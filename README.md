## Some problems I ran into:
1. Passing current user as props to our profile page
2. Modeling our Brewery and Photo models
3. Axios CORS block
4. Pinging our DB from the React front end and passing data from front end to back end
5. Adding functionality for the like/unlike toggle button
6. Git merge issues and Heroku deployment issues because of them
7. Understanding how data was being passed around between back and front end


## Things I didn't get to do/finish:
1. Photo model that would hold photos for a specific brewery
2. AWS for hosting the images for the photo model
3. Search function
4. Animating the Like/Unlike button
5. More styling throughout app
