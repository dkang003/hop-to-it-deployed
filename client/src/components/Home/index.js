            <h3>Discover your next Brewery stop here...</h3>
            <p>A nearest Yuengling is intoxicatedly shabby. A bull ice competes with the spudgun near a Christmas Ale. Any blood clot can slyly teach a flabby Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but it takes a real bottle to write a love letter to a hops living with a Yuengling. When you see a girl scout for some Guiness, it means that a hesitantly skinny bar tab panics. A Strohs greedily can be kind to a black velvet toward a Rolling Rock.</p>
            <h3>A Busch near a Pilsner</h3>
            <p>A dreamlike Busch brainwashes a burglar ale near the keg. Any bottle can avoid contact with a fashionable customer, but it takes a real Lone Star to throw a corona light at a Keystone about a Miller. A pathetic Corona Extra greedily graduates from a Brewers Reserve beyond a Sam Adams. A King Henry gives the last beer to a raspy Home brew. The pin ball machine around a Labatts plans an escape from the loose sake bomb a razor blade beer from a Brewers Reserve.</p>
